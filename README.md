# Quantizer

Adaptive quantization for `torch.nn` modules

## More to come..

- General cleanup in to a proper library
- More agnostic resource monitoring (not just CPU)
- Perplexity calculations based on first N encountered
  samples rather than on an arbitrary dataset
- Profiling
- Better type annotations, docstrings
- Smarter swapping decisions rather than simply
  swapping based on resource thresholds
